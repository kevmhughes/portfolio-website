      <h2 class="title-two">Project Overview</h2>
      <h3 class="title-three">What is it?</h3>
      <p class="case-study-text">
        ChitChat is a native mobile application built using React Native. It
        is a messenging service app that is not dissimilar from WhatsApp given
        that the user can send and receive text messages, photos taken with
        the phone's camera, images or photos from the phone's storage, and
        share the user's location.
      </p>
      <h3 class="title-three">What was the objective?</h3>
      <p class="case-study-text">
        To build a chat app for mobile devices using React Native, and
        Expo.io, as part of the CareerFoundry Web Development course.
      </p>
      <h3 class="title-three">Which tools were used?</h3>
      <div class="case-study-text">
        <div>Server-side: Google Firestore Database, Google Firebase</div>
        <div>Client-side: React Native, Gifted Chat library</div>
        <div>Development Environment: Expo.io</div>

      <h2 class="title-two">Challenges Faced</h2>
      <p class="case-study-text">This project marked my first venture into React Native, and it came with a steep
        learning curve. However, my solid background in React helped me adapt quickly to the framework and navigate its
        unique challenges. One of the biggest obstacles was maintaining patience while working with Expo, an iPhone, and
        a slow, RAM-intensive Android emulator. I discovered that functionality on iOS didn’t always translate smoothly
        to Android, and vice versa, requiring constant testing on both systems. In the process, I truly learned the
        meaning of 'patience is a virtue.'</p>
