                Hi, I'm Kevin Hughes, a passionate web developer based in Barcelona, driven by a love for beautifully designed applications and a commitment to clean, flawless code. I am currently open to full-time and freelance  opportunities. My experience in past roles has sharpened my client-focused approach, enabling me to exceed stakeholder expectations and consistently deliver high-quality work on time, tailored precisely to client needs.
            </p>
            <p class="about-text">
                My goal is to join an energetic, innovative team that pushes the boundaries of digital experiences, creating inspiring applications that go beyond user expectations. I'm eager to collaborate with like-minded professionals who value creativity, technical excellence, and user-centered design. I believe that the best applications not only function seamlessly but also bring delight to their users and make a lasting impact. By contributing my skills in front-end and back-end development, along with a meticulous attention to detail, I aim to enhance every project I work on in turn leaving users and stakeholders truly impressed and thoroughly satisfied.

                    When I am not coding, I love to check out freshly ground coffee from all around the world. In fact my favourite type is the Red Caturra bean from Rwanda. I even had the chance to try the world's most expensive coffee, <i>kopi luwak</i>, in Indonesia, but I'll leave out the details on how it's fermented!

                    I get inspiration from listening to my collection of Jazz, Funk, and Disco records, DJing at Jazz festivals, and producing music. I love music technology in general, and I have lots of equipment such as a Moog synthesiser, a sampler, and other fantastic midi tools.

                    I also love international cuisine, and trying out new, exciting, and scrumptious recipes at home. I especially like Asian, and Mediterranean dishes. This is a wonderful chickpea, red pepper, and cabbage soup I made with homemade stock. Yum, tasty!
