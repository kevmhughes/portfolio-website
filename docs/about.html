    <p class="about-text">
      Hi, I'm Kevin Hughes, a passionate web developer based in the province of Malaga, driven by a love for
      beautifully designed applications and a commitment to clean, flawless code. I am currently open to full-time and
      freelance opportunities. My experi past roles has sharpened my client-focused approach, enabling me to exceed
      stakeholder expectations and consistently deliver high-quality work on time, tailored precisely to client needs.
    </p>
    <p class="about-text">
      My goal is to join an energetic, innovative team that pushes the boundaries of digital experiences, creating
      inspiring applications that go beyond user expectations. I'm eager to collaborate with like-minded professionals
      who value creativity, technical excellence, and user-centered design. I believe that the best applications not
      only function seamlessly but also bring delight to their users and make a lasting impact. By contributing my
      skills in front-end and back-end development, along with a meticulous attention to detail, I aim to enhance
      every project I work on in turn leaving users and stakeholders truly impressed and thoroughly satisfied.

      <img src="./assets/images/coffee.png" alt="coffee bean" class="coffee">
      <p class="about-text">
        When I am not coding, I love to check out freshly ground coffee from all around the world. In fact my
        favourite type is the Red Caturra bean from Rwanda. I even had the chance to try the world's most expensive
        coffee, <i>kopi luwak</i>, in Indonesia, but I'll leave out the details on how it's fermented!
      </p>

      <img src="./assets/images/herbie.jpg" alt="jazz record" class="jazz-record">
      <p class="about-text">
        I get inspiration from listening to my collection of Jazz, Funk, and Disco records, DJing at Jazz festivals,
        and producing music. I love music technology in general, and I have lots of equipment such as a Moog
        synthesiser, a sampler, and other fantastic midi tools.

      <p class="about-text">
        I also love international cuisine, and trying out new, exciting, and scrumptious recipes at home. I especially
        like Asian, and Mediterranean dishes. This is a wonderful chickpea, red pepper, and cabbage soup I made with
        homemade stock. Yum, tasty!
